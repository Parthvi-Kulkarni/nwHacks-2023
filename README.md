Xplore is an all-in-one mobile application designed for indecisive students who want to travel, but struggle to decide where to go and how to get there. As a team of university students ourselves, we know the feeling of wanting to get away from the endless pile of assignments and midterms, but also the feeling of uncertainty and paralysis when actually faced with the thought of planning a trip. "I want to go backpacking in Europe, but where should I start? How should I get there?" The goal of Xplore is to reduce the information overload experienced by students and to leverage a custom recommendation engine trained on travel data to present end-to-end trip itineraries for users based on their personal preferences/interests.
